# Frontend Authentication - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎉 What's Implemented

### ✅ Complete Authentication System

1. **Auth Service** (`/ui/src/lib/services/auth.js`)
   - Login
   - Register
   - Logout
   - Get current user
   - All with `credentials: 'include'` for cookies

2. **Auth Store** (`/ui/src/lib/stores/auth.js`)
   - Centralized authentication state
   - Login/logout methods
   - User info management
   - Role checking (admin vs user)
   - Auth guards for routes

3. **Login Page** (`/ui/src/routes/login/+page.svelte`)
   - Beautiful login form
   - Error handling
   - Test credentials displayed
   - Redirects to home after login

4. **Protected Layout** (`/ui/src/routes/+layout.svelte`)
   - **Mandatory authentication check**
   - Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
   - Loading state while checking auth
   - Shows sidebar/header only when authenticated
   - Public routes: `/login`, `/register`

5. **Updated Header** (`/ui/src/lib/components/Header.svelte`)
   - Shows current username
   - Shows "ADMIN" badge for admins
   - Logout button
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Settings

6. **Updated API Services**
   - All resource API calls include `credentials: 'include'`
   - Sessions automatically sent with every request

## 🔒 Security Features

### Mandatory Authentication
- **ALL pages require authentication** except `/login` and `/register`
- Users are automatically redirected to login if not authenticated
- Session is checked on every route change

### Session Management
- HTTP-only cookies (JavaScript cannot access)
- Sessions stored server-side in MongoDB
- 24-hour session expiration
- Automatic session validation

### Role-Based UI
- Admin users see "ADMIN" badge
- Future: Different UI elements based on role

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start Both Servers

**Backend:**
```bash
./start.sh server
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
./start.sh ui
```

### 2. Open Browser
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. You'll See Login Page
The app will automatically redirect to `/login` if not authenticated.

### 4. Login with Test Accounts

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Regular User:**
- Username: `testuser`
- Password: `test123`

### 5. After Login
- You'll be redirected to the dashboard
- Header shows your username
- All AI agent features are now accessible
- Logout button in header

---

## 📋 User Experience Flow

```
1. User opens app → Redirected to /login
2. User enters credentials → Clicks "Sign in"
3. Backend validates → Creates session → Sets HTTP-only cookie
4. Frontend receives user info → Updates auth store
5. User redirected to dashboard → Full app access
6. All API calls include session cookie automatically
7. User clicks logout → Session destroyed → Redirected to login
```

## 🎯 What's Protected

### Frontend Routes
- `/` - Dashboard (requires auth)
- `/agents/*` - All AI agents (requires auth)
- `/chat` - AI Chat (requires auth)
- `/resources` - Resources (requires auth)
- `/settings` - Settings (requires auth)

### Backend API
- All endpoints except `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/health`
- Resources filtered by owner (users see only their own)
- Admins can see all resources
- Model changes admin-only

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Auth Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Layout calls `auth.init()` → Checks `/auth/me`
2. **Not Authenticated**: Redirects to `/login`
3. **Login**: Calls `/auth/login` → Server sets cookie → Updates store
4. **Route Change**: Reactive statement checks auth → Redirects if needed
5. **Logout**: Calls `/auth/logout` → Clears cookie → Redirects to login

### Cookie Configuration
- Name: `session_id`
- HttpOnly: `true` (JavaScript cannot access)
- SameSite: `lax`
- Secure: `false` (set to `true` in production with HTTPS)
- Max-Age: 86400 seconds (24 hours)

### API Configuration
All fetch calls include:
```javascript
{
  credentials: 'include'  // Include cookies in requests
}
```
