AI and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming the way we interact with technology. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human cognition.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming. These systems improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

Deep learning, a further specialization within machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns in large datasets. This technology powers many modern applications including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

The future of AI promises even more sophisticated applications, from personalized medicine to climate modeling, revolutionizing industries and improving lives worldwide.
